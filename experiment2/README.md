Colors: Utilized colors of the grassy hill, close up mountains, far away mountains, sky, clouds, and several flowers. 

Primitives: Utilized an eclipse to create the sun in the background, and a series of eclipses to create clouds.

Polygons: Created terrain (mountains and hills) utilizing custom-shaped polygons (beginShape/endShape).

Generativity: The composition randomly generates variation in all shapes (terrain, clouds, sun, flowers).

Life: Flowers, sun, and clouds move over time and respond to mouse movement.
